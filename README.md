## Preprocessing
  * [dicom2pngjpeg.ipyng](https://github.com/kool7/Medical_Computer_Vision_Preprocessing_2020/blob/master/Medical%20Image%20Preprocessing/dicom2pngjpeg.ipynb) - This notebook converts dicom images to png/jpeg format and saves them into different folder. This notebook taked dicom files from one folder and convert them to jpeg/png/jpg format and saves them another folder.
  
  
  * [fetchinfo2csv.ipynb](https://github.com/kool7/Medical_Computer_Vision_Preprocessing_2020/blob/master/Medical%20Image%20Preprocessing/fetchinfo2csv.ipynb) - 
 This notebook converts dicom images to png/jpeg format and saves them into different folder. This notebook taked dicom files from one folder and convert them to jpeg/png/jpg format and saves them another folder. It also saves information from dicom files to csv file. 
 
 
  * [filterdata.py](https://github.com/kool7/Medical_Computer_Vision_Preprocessing_2020/blob/master/Filter%20Indices/filterdata.py) - Filter out necessary rows out from one .csv file and saving the filtered out indices in it. 
  
  * [ReName_and_2JPEG.ipynb](https://github.com/kool7/Medical_Computer_Vision_Preprocessing_2020/blob/master/ReName_and_2JPEG.ipynb) - This jupyter notebook contains code to convert images from **.png, .jpg to .jpeg** format and also to rename them in desired form. This is very handy when you want to preprocess your Image data before training your neural network.
